Welcome to "Let's Build X" – a collection of projects where we dive deep into building various libraries and tools from scratch. 
The goal of this repository is to provide hands-on learning experiences for those who want to understand the inner workings 
of different programming concepts by implementing them independently. ✨

## Why Build from Scratch? 🔍
One of the best ways to gain a deep and clear understanding of programming concepts is to implement them from the ground up. 
By building libraries, tools, and frameworks ourselves, we not only sharpen our coding skills but also develop a profound 
comprehension of the underlying principles. 🪄

## Projects 📜
- [Testing Library](https://github.com/mutasim77/lets-build-x/tree/master/testing-library) -  JS Testing Library - for those who want to understand the inner workings of testing libraries.
- [Dynamic Array](https://github.com/mutasim77/lets-build-x/tree/master/dynamic-array) -  Dynamic Array in Java - for those who seek insight into the mechanics of dynamically resizing arrays.
