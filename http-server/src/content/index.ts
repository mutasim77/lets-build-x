      <h1>About My Custom HTTP Web Server üåê</h1>

      <p>This project is a small, custom-built HTTP web server I made to learn how web servers work from the ground up.</p>

      <h2>Why I Built This üõ†Ô∏è</h2>

      <p>I started this project because I was curious. I wanted to know what happens behind the scenes when you type a web address and hit enter. Here's what I aimed to learn:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>How HTTP really works - the language of the web</li>
        <li>How to use Node.js for networking at a low level</li>
        <li>How web servers handle different web addresses (URLs)</li>
        <li>How web servers deal with many users at once</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è</h2>

      <p>This server uses Node.js's 'net' module to create a TCP server. It's like setting up a phone line for computers to talk to each other. Here's what happens when you visit a webpage on this server:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>The server waits for a computer (like your web browser) to call</li>
        <li>When a call comes in, the server listens to what the browser is asking for</li>
        <li>The server looks at the web address to figure out what information to send back</li>
        <li>It prepares the right information (like the text of a webpage)</li>
        <li>Finally, it sends this information back to your browser</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>The Parts of the Server üß©</h2>

      <p>This project is made up of several files, each with a specific job:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>index.ts</strong>: This is like the main control center. It starts everything up.</li>
        <li><strong>Server.ts</strong>: This file sets up the "phone line" for browsers to connect to.</li>
        <li><strong>RequestHandler.ts</strong>: This listens to what the browser is asking for.</li>
        <li><strong>ResponseBuilder.ts</strong>: This prepares the information to send back to the browser.</li>
        <li><strong>Router.ts</strong>: This decides what information to send based on the web address.</li>
        <li><strong>HttpUtils.ts</strong>: This has helper tools for understanding browser requests.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Not Use Existing Tools? ‚ùì</h2>

      <p>You might wonder, "Why build a web server when there are already good ones out there?" It's a fair question! I'm not trying to replace those servers. Instead, I'm learning how they work by building a simple version myself.</p>

      <p>It's like learning to bake bread from scratch. You might not do it every day when you can buy bread at the store, but the process teaches you a lot about what goes into making bread.</p>


      <h2>What's Next? ‚è≠Ô∏è</h2>

      <p>This project is just the beginning. There's still so much to learn and add:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Handling different types of requests (like POST for sending data)</li>
        <li>Adding security features to protect against common web attacks</li>
        <li>Making the server faster by handling multiple requests at the same time</li>
        <li>Adding a way to serve files (like images or CSS) along with web pages</li>
      </ul>

      <p>While this server isn't ready for real-world websites, it's an excellent tool for learning. It's helped me understand what's really happening when I browse the web, and I hope it can help others learn too!</p>
